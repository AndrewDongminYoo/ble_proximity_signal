A Very Good Flutter Federated Plugin created by the [Very Good Ventures Team][very_good_ventures_link].

Generated by the [Very Good CLI][very_good_cli_link]. 🤖

## Overview

`ble_proximity_signal` is a **foreground-only** BLE proximity module for a “metal detector” style UX. It advertises a short token, scans nearby tokens, and maps RSSI to **intensity values (0..1)** for app-controlled feedback.

## Packages

- `ble_proximity_signal/`: public Dart API + signal processing
- `ble_proximity_signal_platform_interface/`: shared platform contracts/models
- `ble_proximity_signal_android/`: Android implementation
- `ble_proximity_signal_ios/`: iOS implementation

## Implementation Goals (v0.1.0)

- Foreground **advertising + scanning** on iOS/Android (latest devices).
- Filter up to **5 target tokens** and emit a continuous `Stream<ProximityEvent>`.
- RSSI smoothing (EMA), hysteresis for near/veryNear, and intensity mapping.
- Example app supports broadcast start/stop, scan start/stop, and per-target RSSI/intensity/proximity level.
- **Non-goals:** background guarantees, distance-in-meters, rolling IDs (v0.2+), or built-in sound/vibration/notifications.

## Integration tests 🧪

Very Good Flutter Plugin uses [fluttium][fluttium_link] for integration tests. Those tests are located
in the front facing package `ble_proximity_signal` example.

**❗ In order to run the integration tests, you need to have the `fluttium_cli` installed. [See how][fluttium_install].**

To run the integration tests, run the following command from the root of the project:

```sh
cd ble_proximity_signal/example
fluttium test flows/test_platform_name.yaml
```
